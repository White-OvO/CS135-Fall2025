1.4 Exercises
1. What is a compiler?
A compiler is a source code read in pure english . 

2. How is compiled code different from source code?
Source code is machine langue while compiled is the outcome of the computer 

3. What tool does a programmer use to produce C++ source code?
Programmers use a Proccedor which includes libarys to run code. 

4. What tool(s) does a programmer use to convert C++ source code into executable machine code?
An assembler 

5. What does the linker do?
combines the compilars and the libarys for the code to execute. 

6. Does the linker deal with files containing source code or machine language code?
No 

7. What does the preprocessor do to source code?
adds or modified the files the content of the files. ( libars  ) before the code gets compilied . 
8. List several advantages developing software in a higher-level language has over developing software in machine language.
9. How can an IDE improve a programmerâ€™s productivity?
10. Name a popular C++ IDE used by programmers developing for Microsoft Windows.
11. Name a popular C++ IDE used by programmers developing for Apple macOS.

// level of programming languges  
// machine language 
/*  this was how the first machine langues were written . 
0s and 1 s ( binary instructions )
machine dependent ( hardware specific )
Example 0100100 101001 
Note : 

Assembler * tool to help us write a diffrent languge . Or the assemble language. 


The source code is then convertered by g ++ to a text processor ) preprocessor ) 


-- > complier ( optimizes code checks syntax error and type errors. 
syntax - , or >* a compilar is turned then into a assemble languge. 

)


Source code --> preprocessor -- > compiler - >  assembler - > linker - > loadr ( links the libarys Executable into memory , links  dynamic libairs ) 



LIbarys -- 

link up libarys ( 
for example baking a cake you need instructions ; flour , waer, 

- if you want to make your flour you can or you can buy the ingredients for the formula . 
)

already defined in the libary  . 
-------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 
Problem analysiss and specification = understanding the problem, define inputes /outputs constriaints. 
EX: asking your family for what they want to eat 
out put / outcome = they wants pancakes



General solutions - create step by step procedure ( pseudocode / flowchart )
Step for this the ingredients . all the steps to cooking the cakes.  
( write the pschedo code . )

Veification - check if the algothrim wokrs for diffrent cases . 
( very if the algothrim works or not )


Implementation - cooking of the pancake ( translate algothrim into a programming language . )


Testing and debugging - run program , fix errors, compare results with specification . ) 


Maintance and improvement - update program as requirements , change, optimize if needed . 




----------------------------------------------------------

What is an algorithm ? 
step by step proccedor to solve a problem in a finite amount of time. 

proprties - 
Finitie - must end adrwr some steps 
Definite -> each step is clear and unambiguous . 
Inpute -> zero or more values supplied. 
output -> one or more results produced. 
Effective -> each step os double in pratice .

Syntax vs semantics 
in theatre  
syntax : the script  
Semantics : the emotion behind the dialogues

Syntax is the grammer / rules if the programming language . 





Syntax cs semantis - in english language
